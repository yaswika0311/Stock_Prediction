<h1 align="center">S&P 500 Index Price Prediction</h1>

## Overview

This personal project revolves around predicting the daily performance of the S&P 500 stock market index. Using historical data, I've built and fine-tuned machine learning models to forecast whether the market will go up or down on a particular day. The project unfolds in several steps, commencing with data collection through the yfinance package. After obtaining the historical data, I've constructed an initial machine learning model to estimate market direction. To enhance accuracy, I've introduced a backtesting engine, allowing for more rigorous performance evaluation under diverse market conditions. Continuous model improvement remains a core focus, as I explore advanced machine learning techniques and incorporate insights from the backtesting results.<br><br>

## Project Steps

-  ### Data Collection

   We download historical data related to the S&P 500 stock market index using the `yfinance` package. This dataset forms the foundation for our predictive modeling.<br>
     

-  ### Initial Machine Learning Model

    In this step, we create an initial machine learning model to predict the S&P 500 index's price. We use a basic model to get an estimate of the model's accuracy.

-  ### Backtesting Engine

   To measure accuracy more rigorously, we build a backtesting engine. This tool helps us evaluate the model's performance under various conditions and market scenarios.

-   ### Model Improvement

    Continuous improvement is essential. We work on enhancing the accuracy of the model based on backtesting results and potentially explore more advanced machine learning techniques.<br><br>
